## Rules

1. Get as far away from the door as possible.
2. Try not to stand next to another dude.
3. Really try not to stand next to two other dudes.

The exceptions are not that complicated either. Rules 2 and 3 can be violated in one of two cases:
- There is a line
- Someone else has already broken that particular rule.
